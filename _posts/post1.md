## College Application Update

![umich-submission](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/864384674033434624/1036493968805998702/unknown.png)

I just submitted my Early Action colleges! It definitely feels like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

After the UCs, all of my next favorite schools are definitely my EA schools (UMich, GTech, UIUC) so not having to stress about their application anymore feels nice. 

Ultimately, I'm content with how the essays turned out. They aren't the best in the world but I'm happy with the effort I put into them.

I think a lot of the people around me have been pannicking and whining about college apps. I hate college apps even more than the average student, but I think I've accepted that if I don't go to where I want to for my undergrad, my career or academic prospects probably won't be too different regardless. 

There's nothing inherently evil about the college application process, as unfair and painful as it can seem. I think in a lot of other countries (India and China to name a few), getting a good education is the easiest way to move up socioeconomically. However, in the US, you can quite literally get the same Google job as an MIT graduate even if you go to a UC after transferring from a community college. 

All the pressure comes from ourself, our parents, and society. College is definitely important, and I am part of the problem more than the average student if anything(Berkeley plz accept me). But I disagree with the sentiment of people acting like going to UC Merced is equivalent of getting sent to the gulag. 

## Thoughts on Life

This past month or so has probably been some of the most unfun weeks of my life :( I really enjoy all of my classes this year but wish I had more time to spend towards them. 

I just have to keep the throttle down for a few more weeks until UCs are done. I'm not too enthusiastic about my regular decision schools anyway so I'm not that stressed over them. 

I've been really enjoying going to school in general and just talking and meeting new people. In general I took school to seriously when I was younger and I regret not doing more things. I rarely went out with friends and I've never been to a school social until I went to Homecoming this year.

In a way I feel like I got my high school experience stolen. Especially my freshman and sophomore year I was so caught up with school I didn't spend as much time as I wish I did on just having fun. 

And ultimately, there isn't fruition I can show for all this work. Sure, there is the chance I get into a "prestigious" college. But ultimately, my only motive to go to a good college is to get a good education and explore my interests. I don't want to become one of those students whos entire personality is they go to XYZ College. 

I just hate this feeling of losing my childish nature and instincts. I won't be able to go to those simple birthday parties or have my parents do things for me. Hell, I almost made it through high school without going to a single Homecoming event. 

It's ironic (and quite common) how when I was younger I always wished I was older, and how that now when I am older, I wish I was younger. 

But I'm still excited for what the future holds and I'm glad to have so many nice and caring people around me.

Heres a picture of me getting Mehndi at a diwali party!
